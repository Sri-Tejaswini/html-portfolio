<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sri Tejaswini. I'm a Web Developer. Other than coding in my laptop, I also like to play games. My favourite movie genre is Horror. One day I aspire to build a horror game which is really different from all the games out there and hopefully makes the users get jumpscares</p>

Some of my specialities are I deliver the projects in a good amount of time and I can assure you that you'll be pleased with my work. I always encourage my clients to be open abouyt any changes thst they require because you can't compromise on perfection, right?
